Software\r\nsimulating earthquake rupture dynamics may not have a good estimation of background stress due to longterm\r\ntectonic deformations. In this study, we develop a numerical framework that embeds earthquake rupture\r\ndynamics into a long-term tectonic deformation model by adding inertial terms and using highly adaptive\r\ntime-stepping that can capture deformation at plate-motion rates as well as individual earthquakes. The inertia\r\nterm, which is neglected in long-term large-scale modeling methods, is considered to simulate the dynamic\r\nrupture processes. The rate-and-state frictional relationship for co-seismic fault slip is implemented in\r\nviscoelastic-plastic earth. Benchmarks of viscous flow, viscoelastic wave propagation and earthquake cycle\r\nsimulations are tested. Based on these benchmarks, we undertake a generic study of a thrust fault in crust.\r\nWe find that lower crustal rheology affects the periodic time of characteristic large earthquake cycles and the\r\ninter-seismic free surface movement. Cratons with a relatively strong lower crust due to lower temperature\r\nremain two peaks in surface uplift profiles around the fault zone for thousands of years after one characteristic\r\nearthquake, which help identify active faults in cratons.", "abstract": "Visco-elastic-plastic modeling approaches for long-term tectonic deformation assume that\r\nco-seismic fault displacement can be integrated over 1000s\u201310,000s years (tens of earthquake cycles) with the\r\nappropriate failure law, and that short-timescale fluctuations in the stress field due to individual earthquakes\r\nhave no effect on long-term behavior. Models of the earthquake rupture process generally assume that the\r\ntectonic (long-range) stress field or kinematic boundary conditions are steady over the course of multiple\r\nearthquake cycles. This study is aimed to fill the gap between long-term and short-term deformations by\r\nmodeling earthquake cycles with the rate-and-state frictional (RSF) relationship in Navier-Stokes equations.\r\nWe reproduce benchmarks at the earthquake timescale to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We\r\nthen discuss how these high-resolution models degrade if the time-step cannot capture the rupture process\r\naccurately and, from this, infer when it is important to consider coupling of the two timescales and the level of\r\naccuracy required. To build upon these benchmarks, we undertake a generic study of a thrust fault in the crust\r\nwith a prescribed geometry. It is found that lower crustal rheology affects the periodic time of characteristic\r\nearthquake cycles and the inter-seismic, free-surface deformation rate. In particular, the relaxation of the\r\nsurface of a cratonic region (with a relatively strong lower crust) has a characteristic double-peaked uplift\r\nprofile that persists for thousands of years after a major slip event.
