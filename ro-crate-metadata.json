Software\r\nsimulating earthquake rupture dynamics may not have a good estimation of background stress due to longterm\r\ntectonic deformations. In this study, we develop a numerical framework that embeds earthquake rupture\r\ndynamics into a long-term tectonic deformation model by adding inertial terms and using highly adaptive\r\ntime-stepping that can capture deformation at plate-motion rates as well as individual earthquakes. The inertia\r\nterm, which is neglected in long-term large-scale modeling methods, is considered to simulate the dynamic\r\nrupture processes. The rate-and-state frictional relationship for co-seismic fault slip is implemented in\r\nviscoelastic-plastic earth. Benchmarks of viscous flow, viscoelastic wave propagation and earthquake cycle\r\nsimulations are tested. Based on these benchmarks, we undertake a generic study of a thrust fault in crust.\r\nWe find that lower crustal rheology affects the periodic time of characteristic large earthquake cycles and the\r\ninter-seismic free surface movement. Cratons with a relatively strong lower crust due to lower temperature\r\nremain two peaks in surface uplift profiles around the fault zone for thousands of years after one characteristic\r\nearthquake, which help identify active faults in cratons.", "funder": [{"@id": "https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"}, {"@id": "https://ror.org/04yx6dh41"}], "hasPart": [{"@id": "model_inputs"}, {"@id": "model_outputs"}, {"@id": "website_material"}, {"@id": "metadata_trail"}, {"@id": "#datasetCreation"}], "identifier": [], "isBasedOn": [], "isPartOf": "http://dx.doi.org/10.25914/yrzp-g882", "keywords": ["Earthquake Cycles", "Navier-Stokes", "Viscoelastic-Plasticity", "Cratonic Earthquakes"], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode", "name": "Numerical Modeling of Earthquake Cycles Based On Navier-Stokes Equations With Viscoelastic-Plasticity Rheology", "publisher": [{"@id": "https://ror.org/04s1m4564"}, {"@id": "https://ror.org/04yx6dh41"}], "spatialCoverage": "", "temporalCoverage": "", "url": ["https://mate.science/models/yang-2023-eqcycles/", "https://github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/yang-2023-eqcycles/"], "version": "", "funding": {"@id": "_:b0"}}, {"@id": ".metadata_trail", "@type": "Dataset", "hasPart": [{"@id": "metadata_trail/issue_body.md"}, {"@id": "metadata_trail/issue_dict.json"}, {"@id": "metadata_trail/nci_iso.csv"}, {"@id": "metadata_trail/ro-crate-metadata-nested.json"}], "name": ".metadata_trail"}, {"@id": ".website_material", "@type": ["Dataset", "CreativeWork"], "creator": [{"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8628-3704"}, {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3685-174X"}, {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2936-2342"}, {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4515-9296"}], "description": "material for m@te website", "fileFormat": "./", "name": ".website_material"}, {"@id": "_:b0", "@type": "Grant", "funder": {"@id": "https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"}, "identifier": "#42030306"}, {"@id": "_:b1", "@type": "Person", "familyName": "Velic", "givenName": "Mirko"}, {"@id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023gc010872", "@type": "ScholarlyArticle", "abstract": "Visco\u2010elastic\u2010plastic modeling approaches for long\u2010term tectonic deformation assume that co\u2010seismic fault displacement can be integrated over 1000s\u201310,000s years (tens of earthquake cycles) with the appropriate failure law, and that short\u2010timescale fluctuations in the stress field due to individual earthquakes have no effect on long\u2010term behavior.
